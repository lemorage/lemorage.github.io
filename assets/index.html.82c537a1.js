As it turned out, this decision was unnecessary because fate had a different plan for me. My major was actually assigned to me due to a university policy. It was an unusual experience for me as a new adult, but it taught me that unexpected outcomes can sometimes lead to positive results.</p><p>As an archaeology student, I quickly realized that the workload was heavy, especially for someone with little prior knowledge. Motivated by my desire to achieve a high GPA, I worked hard to understand all the material covered in class, and after much effort, I felt like I had achieved my primary goal.</p><p>However, my story doesn&#39;t end there. When I reflect on my time as an undergraduate, my mind immediately jumps to my fieldwork experiences. Fieldwork is essential in archaeology for acquiring practical knowledge, and it was an adventure for me. I learned so much from my time spent in the field.</p><p>During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to participate in a few archaeological excavations. These were unforgettable experiences that allowed me to apply what I had learned in the classroom to real-world situations. I remember the excitement of being part of a team that was uncovering artifacts that had been buried for centuries. It was amazing to think about the stories that these objects could tell about the people who had lived in that place so long ago.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+r+'" width="45%" height="10%"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><em>An excavation site revealing layers of history through the careful excavation of artifacts and structures</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>One excavation, in particular, stands out in my memory. It was located in a remote part of China, and we had to hike several miles to reach the site. The conditions were challenging - we had to camp out in tents and deal with sweltering heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. But despite the difficulties, I felt an incredible sense of camaraderie with my fellow archaeologists. We were all united in our mission to uncover the past, and it was amazing to see how everyone worked together to achieve that goal.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+s+'" width="80%" height="40%"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><em>In the zone, I tackled analyzing and documenting geological formations with precision and skill.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+l+'" width="48%" height="24%"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;"><em>Bones of the past, unearthed from the ground</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking back on those years, I realize how much I learned and grew as a person. Not only did I gain a deep appreciation for the history of our world, but I also developed valuable skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. And perhaps most importantly, I discovered my true passion for learning advanced technologies and contributing to the world. I am extremely passionate about this and am driven to acquire solid principles and theories that ground my knowledge and make it practical. This charming fascination continues to inspire me to this day. <img src="'+d+'" width="85%" height="55%"><br></p><h2 id="self-introduction-as-a-programmer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#self-introduction-as-a-programmer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Self-Introduction as a Programmer</h2><h3 id="introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Introduction</h3><p>Hello, my name is <i>Miao</i>, and I am a semi-software developer, currently pursuing my Master&#39;s degree in Computer Science from the University of Galway, which I will receive in 2023.
